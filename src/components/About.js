                            <p>I graduated with <b>First Class Honours in BSc Computer Science</b> from the <b>University of Exeter</b> ðŸŽ“</p>
                            <p>This has given me the chance to learn numerous programming languages, and gain experience both collaborating with teams and working on my own. I pride myself on going beyond the code. This includes producing high quality tests, documentation, and support with deployment and maintenance</p>
