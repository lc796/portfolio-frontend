                        <h2>What I can do</h2>
                        <p>I can design beautiful front-end websites using HTML/CSS/JS/React, alongside various other frameworks and libraries. I also have experience with back-end development working with a variety of languages, including SQL, Java, Python, and PHP. Technologies I have used include: Linux, Git, NodeJS, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, Bukkit/Spigot API, Xenforo, and MyBB. If you have something else that I might be able to help with, why not get in contact? <b>All quotes free of charge.</b></p>

                        <h2>My experience</h2>
                        <p>I am expecting to graduate with a <b>First Class Honours in BSc Computer Science</b> from the <b>University of Exeter</b>. This has given me the chance to learn numerous programming languages, and gain experience both collaborating with teams and working on my own. I pride myself on going beyond the code. This includes producing high quality tests, documentation, and support with deployment and maintenance.</p>

                        <p>I am someone who is keen to learn and improve, and I always approach tasks with humility. I enjoy working out and training, and have competed in amateur boxing bouts. I also enjoy hiking, nature and animals. And, of course, no programmer is complete without having acquired a taste for coffee.</p>
